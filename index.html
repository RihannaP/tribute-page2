    <h2 id="description-title" class="description"><strong>Follow your Dreams</strong></h2>
  
    <p id="explain" class="description">We have all heard this phrase many times, "follow your dreams".
It may seem far-fetched or seem like a slogan at first, but time proves that every person in a difficult situation must choose to follow the dream or give it up.
Rihanna was a girl who played with her father's white calculator since she was a child and all she liked was pressing its keys. Father's small calculator was a world of wonder for her and she was delighted whenever something changed on the screen by pressing each key.
Later, this interest turned into typing and working with the DOS operating system, and now the wonder of the whiteness of the calculator had turned into the blackness of the computer screen and its commands.
When she got older, she chose the field of sciences because she thought she would become a nurse or a doctor in the future, without realizing that her dream was hidden inside the zeros and ones of the computer.
As more time passed, she realized that her world is more familiar with problem solving and mathematics than with experiments and blood.
Now after a long time, Rihanna is looking for her dream. An opportunity that maybe now she should use with all her heart.
    I am here to program and code my future and my dreams :)</p><br>
